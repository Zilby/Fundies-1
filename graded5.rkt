;Problem 1

;;<< Part 1: 6/6

;#1
;An Item is one of:
;-a letter
;-a box

(define-struct letter (address weight))
;A letter is a (make-letter String Number)
;Interpretation: the weight of a letter must be less than 3.5 ounces
;the cost of a letter is 50 cents

(define-struct box (height width length weight))
;A box is a (make-box Number Number Number Number)
;Interpretation: the weight of a box must be less than
;or equal to 800 ounces
;The sum of the height, width, and length of a box
;must be less than or equal to 62 inches
;The product of the height, width, and length of a box
;must be less than or equal to 7938 cubic inches
;The cost of a box is 15 cents per ounce
