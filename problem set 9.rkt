"distance" is measured by adding 1 for each internal node on the
way from the root to the leaf.|#

#|A leafy binary tree is a binary tree with the symbol 'leaf
at its leafs (as opposed to, say, a number).
Design a function that consumes a natural number n and creates
(a list of) all the leafy binary trees that have height n.
Hint: Design a function that consumes a natural number n, and
creates (a list of) all leafy binary trees of height equal
or less than n.
Hint: If you have to use filter to remove things from the
list, youâ€™re working too hard.
Hint: It might be helpful to draw pictures.|#
